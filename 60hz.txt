At Project Navigator at top left select IP Components.
Right click Entity "pll" -> Edit in parameter editor.

There you see Desired Frequency 96.0 & 48.0 Mhz. For 60Hz you need 60/59.18 x 96Mhz = 97.330180 and 48.665090. Enter those both at Desired Frequency and then make sure Actual Frequency matches exactly. Finally click Finish.

1) install Quartus lite v17.0 (once)
2) Install git (once)
3) Get/update source code from repo
4) Modify Entity pll from 96 to 97.330180 and 48 to 48.665090
5) Compile core
6) Profit


In neogeo.sv:
cfg_data <= sys_mvs_r ? 2576980378 : 2865308404;
The first is for MVS and the second for AES. The number for 60Hz should be 3148288251. So just change one or both numbers.

You might also still need to change the PLL to the higher clocks if it is unstable.

Final line in neogeo.sv around line 384:
	cfg_data <= sys_mvs_r ? 3148288251 : 2865308404;
